This project is out of date. At the moment we work on a fork with GTK+ GUI support.


YTRipper is able to download almost all YouTube videos and instantly convert them to ".mp3".

Planned features are: playlist ripping function, automatic artist and title recognising, id3tag setting.

PLEASE NOTICE: You may not download content that's not uploaded by you!
